# TowerDefenceDemo

This game plays exactly as Plants vs Zombies.

There are three types of towers (Defenders):

  -Circle: Like sunflowers in Plants vs Zombies, this tower adds money to buy other towers.

  -Triangle: Shoots bullets when an enemy is its lane.

  -Hexagon: Applies damage when colliding with enemies.


In the case of the Attackers, there are also three types:

  -Red: Moves faster than the others, attacks a tower when colliding with it.

  -Pink: Shoots bullets the towers that are in its lane.

  -Blue: Slowest attacker, hard to kill. Attacks a tower when colliding with it.
