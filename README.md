# TowerDefenceDemo

This game plays exactly as Plants vs Zombies.
There are three types of towers (Defenders):

Circle: Like sunflowers in Plants vs Zombies, this tower adds money to buy other towers.
Triangle: Shoots bullets when an enemy is its lane.
Hexagon: Applies damage when colliding with enemies.

In the case of the Attackers, there are also three types:
Red: Moves faster than the others, attacks a tower when colliding with it.
Pink: Shoots bullets the towers that are in its lane.
Blue: Slowest attacker, hard to kill. Attacks a tower when colliding with it.
